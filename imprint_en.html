      <p>This website is part of a research project, sponsored by the Free State of Bavaria, driven by the BMW Group with friendly assistance of the Business Campus Management GmbH. The goal is to improve the daily commute by developing, testing and offering a new digital service – together with the users of the Business Campus Parkring in Garching.</p>
      <p>To better understand the current commuting experience and to be able to offer a suitable service, we ask to answer several questions. Replying to the offered questions is completely optional.  The data that is collected during this project, will be utilized for the development and optimization of the service. To the extent possible, the data is only utilized in an anonymous manner.</p>
      <p>Your email-address is only stored, if you press submit on the final page, within the scope of this research project. The use of your data for the purpose of advertisement or market investigation is only legalized in case of your explicit agreement.</p>
